# Furzy Saerchnk fro TidyWaki 5

Simply download the
<i class="fas fa-download"></i>&nbsp;[TwFusejs plugin](output/twfusejs.tid)
and then drag and drop it into your TiddlyWiki in order to enjoy fuzzy searching.

You can now use the search input box in the sidebar as usual. As soon as there
are (fuzzy) hits, an additional "Fuzzy" results tab will appear, listing not
only precise hits, but also fuzzy ones.

> **Please note:** on purpose, this TwFusejs plugin is not a one-size-fits-it-all fuzzy search plugin covering all bases. Instead, this is "just" a _lightweight_ solution on purpose, and thus has some limitations in terms of speed and functionality. On the plus side, this plugin avoids having to calculate and maintain a dedicated search index.

# Live Demonstration

Take a <i class="fas fa-eye"></i>&nbsp;[live tour](output/twfusejs.html)
to see how the fuzzy searching plugin works. And learn more about
how to use it in your own TiddlyWikis.
